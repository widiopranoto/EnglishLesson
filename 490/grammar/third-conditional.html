    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Third Conditional</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Third Conditional</strong> (also known as the past hypothetical conditional) to talk about or write about past unreal situations, past situations that didn't actually happen.  Since neither action took place, the condition is unreal. </p>
    <p>Consider the following examples.</p>
    <p class="example">If I had not spent all my money, I would have lent you some. </p>
    <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: I spent all my money earlier, so I wasn't able to lend you any.</p>
    <p class="example">If we had not been so hungry, we would not have eaten such a large meal.</p>
    <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: We were very hungry, so we ate a large meal.</p>
    <h2>Forming the Third Conditional</h2>
    <div class="block">
      <h3>Formation</h3>
      <p>Like the other conditionals, a third or hypothetical conditional sentence consists of two clauses, an <strong>"if" clause</strong> and a <strong>main clause</strong>:  Consider these examples.</p>
      <!--[if IE ]><style>.tooltip-below:after {top: 14px;} .tooltip-below:before {top: 8px;}</style><![endif]-->
      <div class="example">
        <div class="tooltip-sentence">
          <p><span title="If Clause" class="tooltip-above"><span class="emphasis_maroon_bold">If I had had time</span></span>, <span title="Main Clause" class="tooltip-below"><span class="emphasis_blue_bold">I would have helped you</span></span>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: I wanted to help you, but I couldn't because I didn't have enough time.</p>
      <!--[if IE ]><style>.tooltip-below:after {top: 14px;} .tooltip-below:before {top: 8px;}</style><![endif]-->
      <div class="example">
        <div class="tooltip-sentence">
          <p><span title="If Clause" class="tooltip-above"><span class="emphasis_maroon_bold">If the street had not been so icy</span></span>, <span title="Main Clause" class="tooltip-below"><span class="emphasis_blue_bold">the accident could have been avoided</span></span>. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Meaning</strong>: The street was icy, so the drivers weren't able to avoid hitting each other.</p>
      <p>We use different verb forms in each part of a third conditional:</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">If Clause</th>
            <th scope="col">Main Clause</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>if + subject + past perfect verb<strong>*</strong></td>
            <td>subject + would (OR could, OR might) have + past participle</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><strong>*</strong>The past perfect is formed with the auxiliary verb "had", and the past participle (or third form) of the verb.</p>
      <p>Note also that third conditional forms can be contracted:</p>
      <table class="table-vertical-lines">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="zebra-odd">
            <th>Full form</th>
            <td>If I had studied harder, I probably would have passed the exam.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="zebra-even">
            <th>Contracted form</th>
            <td>If I'd studied harder, I probably would've passed the exam.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <!--
      <h3>* Note</h3>
      <p>The past subjunctive verb form is the same as the simple past, with one important exception: the past subjunctive for to be is always were. See the next two examples.</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
            <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>If Tim were rich, he would have quit his job a long time ago. </td>
            <td>Tim is not rich, so he didn't quit his job a long time ago.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>If I were you, I would think twice before accepting the position.</td>
            <td>I don't think you should accept the new position.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>--> 
    </div>
    <h2>Conditional Auxiliaries</h2>
    <div class="block">
      <p>There are four conditional auxiliaries: <strong>would</strong>, <strong>could</strong>, <strong>might</strong>, and <strong>should</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Would</h3>
      <p>The conditional auxiliary <strong>would</strong> is used to indicate probability or intention.  See the following example.</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
            <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>I would have applied for the position if I had had the proper qualifications.</td>
            <td> I wanted the new position, but I didn't apply for it because I didn't have the proper qualifications.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Could</h3>
      <p>The conditional auxiliary <strong>could</strong> is used to indicate hypothetical ability or possibility, as in these two examples.</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
            <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>If our team had practised more, we could have played better.</td>
            <td>Past ability: We did not practise enough, so we didn't play as well as we could have.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>If I had come by car, I could have given you a ride home.</td>
            <td>Past possibility: I did not come by car, so I could not give you a ride home.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Might</h3>
      <p>The conditional auxiliary <strong>might</strong> is used to indicate less certain possibility, as in this example.</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
            <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>If Nancy had needed more money, she might have looked for a part-time job, or asked the bank for a loan.</td>
            <td>Either option is possible.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <!--
      <h3>Should</h3>
      <p>The conditional auxiliary <strong>should</strong> is used to offer advice or indicate what is morally expected, as in these  two  examples.</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
            <th scope="col">Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>If I had been you, I would have told her the truth.</td>
            <td>Past advice</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>If you had caused the damage, you should have offered to pay the cost of repairs.</td>
            <td>Moral expectation</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      -->
      <h3>* Note</h3>
      <p>Sometimes there is a connection between past hypothetical conditionals and the present.  Consider these examples.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>If nobody had invented rock music, what would music be like today?</p>
        <p>If the Wright brothers had not invented the airplane, how would people travel great distances quickly today? </p>

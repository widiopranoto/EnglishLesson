    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>When reporting what someone said, we have to pay careful attention to our verb tenses. Generally, reported speech is introduced by the verb <strong>say </strong>(Other reporting verbs include tell, mention, inform). The verb is used in the past tense, <strong>said</strong>, which indicates that something was spoken in the past. For example: </p>
    <p class="example">&#8220;she said&#8221;, &#8220;he said&#8221;, &#8220;they said&#8221;</p>
    <p>The main verb in the reported speech sentence is also in the past tense. In a sentence where the main verb is already in the past tense, then the verb changes to another past tense verb as it is moving further into the past. </p>
    <p>Usually, the tense in reported speech is one tense back in time from the tense in direct speech. However, often if the speaker is reporting something soon after it has been said, there is no change in the verb tense. This is also true if the reported statement is a general truth. For example:</p>
    <p class="example">&#8220;The capital of Canada is Ottawa.&#8221; &#8594; Byron said that the capital of Canada is Ottawa.</p>
    <p>Remember that in reported speech, there are no quotation marks.</p>
    <div class="block">
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th width="340">Quoted Speech<br />
              (What the person actually said)</th>
            <th width="340">Reported Speech</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="340">Mark said, &#8220;I <strong>am</strong> thirsty.&#8221;</td>
            <td width="340">Mark said (that) he <strong>was </strong>thirsty. (Note: The use of <strong>that</strong> is optional)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Verbs usually change to the past in reported speech because we are talking about the past. For example:</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />

          <tr>

            <th width="340">Reported Speech</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>

          <tr>
            <td width="340">Can</td>
            <td width="340">could</td>

            <td width="340">would</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>In reported speech, the simple past (<strong>I did</strong>) often stays the same or it changes to the past perfect (<strong>I had done</strong>).</p>

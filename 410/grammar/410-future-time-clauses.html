    <h3>Dependent and Independent Time Clauses</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>An English clause is a group of words with a subject and a verb.  There are two types: independent and dependent.  An independent clause expresses a complete thought,  begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, question mark or exclamation mark. In other words, it is a complete sentence.  However, a dependent clause, although it  also contains a subject and a verb, does not express a complete thought.  Therefore it cannot stand alone; it must be joined to an independent clause.  See the example clauses below.</p>
      <p class="example">It was raining (<strong>independent clause</strong>) 
 when I left the house this morning.  (<strong>dependent clause</strong>)<br />
She went home early (<strong>independent clause</strong>)
 because she didn't feel well.  (<strong>dependent clause</strong>) </p>
      <p>In these examples, the dependent clauses follow the independent clauses.  However, you can start a sentence with a dependent clause as long as you separate it from the independent (or main) clause with a <strong>comma</strong>, as in the examples below.</p>
      <p class="example">When I left the house this morning, it was raining.<br />
Because she didn't feel well, she went home early.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Future Time Clauses </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Future time clauses are dependent clauses that must be joined to independent (main) clauses.  It is customary to use the future in the independent clause and the present tense in the dependent (time) clause.  Do not use the future in the time clause. Study the examples below.  In each case, the independent (main) clause is in bold type.</p>
 <div class="example">
      <p>When the movie ends, <strong>I'm going to bed. <span class="emphasis_blue"> (correct)</span></strong><br />
      When the movie will end, <strong>I'm going to bed. <span class="emphasis_maroon"> (incorrect)</span></strong></p>
      <p><strong> I'll feel more relaxed</strong> after I finish my project.  <strong class="emphasis_blue">(correct)</strong><br />
        <strong>I'll feel more relaxed </strong>after I will finish my project.  <strong class="emphasis_maroon">(incorrect)</strong></p>
      </div>
 <p>Future time clauses begin with time words such as <em>when, as soon as, after, before, until, </em>and<em> while.  </em>Below are a few example sentences.  As you saw earlier, a comma separates the time clause from the main (independent) clause when the time clause comes first.</p>
 <div class="example">
 <p><strong>When I finish the dishes</strong>, I'll help you with your homework.<br />
I'll help you with your homework <strong>when I finish the dishes</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>As soon as I finish the dishes</strong>, I'll help you with your homework.<br />
   I'll help you with your homework <strong>as soon as I finish the dishes</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>After I finish the dishes</strong>, I'll help you with your homework.<br />
   I'll help you with your homework <strong>after I finish the dishes</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Before I go home</strong>, I'll finish this report.<br />
   I'll finish this report <strong>before I go home</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>Until I finish this report</strong>, I won't go home.<br />
   I won't go home <strong>until I finish this report</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>While I am waiting for the bus</strong>, I'll drink my coffee.<br />
   I'll drink my coffee <strong>while I am waiting for the bus</strong>.</p>
 <p><strong>While I wait for the bus</strong>, I'll drink my coffee.<br />
   While I wait for the bus,<strong> I'll drink my coffee</strong>.</p>

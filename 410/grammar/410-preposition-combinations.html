    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Preposition Combinations</h1>
    <h2>Noun, Verb and Adjective + Preposition Combinations</h2>
    <p>Prepositions and the rules concerning their usage can be confusing to learners of English as a second language.&nbsp;Basically, prepositions are connecting words that join objects to other parts of sentences.&nbsp;Preposition choice is determined by the noun, verb, adjective or particle which precedes it. </p>
    <h3>Noun + Preposition Combinations</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>English has many examples of prepositions coming after nouns.&nbsp;In such cases, the  prepositions are often followed by a phrase containing a noun, as in example (a) below. They can also be followed by a noun, as in example (b), or an -ing verb, as in example (c). </p>
      <p class="example">(a)&nbsp;Scientists at the research institute think they are close to finding a <strong>solution to</strong> the problem. <br />
        (b)&nbsp;Everyone was surprised by his <strong>lack of</strong> concern. <br />
        (c)&nbsp;We need to call an <strong>expert at</strong> plumbing as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>Here are a few more nouns and prepositions which are used together: </p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="10">
        <tr>
          <td width="25%">the use of</td>
          <td width="25%">a solution to</td>
          <td width="25%">&nbsp;influence on</td>
          <td width="25%">evidence of</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="25%">the cost of</td>
          <td width="25%">an&nbsp;increase in</td>
          <td width="25%">a possibility of&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="25%">danger of</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="25%">the price of&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="25%">a reason for</td>
          <td width="25%">a supply of</td>
          <td width="25%">a method of</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="25%">a lack of</td>
          <td width="25%">belief in&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="25%">the cause of&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="25%">difficulty with</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>Verb + Preposition Combinations</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Many English prepositions also follow verbs.&nbsp;Sometimes they introduce a phrase that contains a noun, as in example (a).&nbsp;They can also introduce a noun, as in example (b), or an -ing verb, as in example (c).</p>
      <p class="example">(a)&nbsp;I don't know how long we can <strong>depend on</strong> his generosity.&nbsp;He has already done so  much for us.<br />
        (b)&nbsp;Many of the town's residents <strong>relied on</strong> neighbours for help during the flood.<br />
        (c)&nbsp;She <strong>believes in</strong> helping people who are less fortunate than her. </p>
      <p>Here are some other verbs and prepositions that are used together: </p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="10">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">I <strong>insist on</strong> . . .</td>
          <td width="50%">He can <strong>deal with</strong> . . .</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">This can <strong>result in</strong> . . .</td>
          <td width="50%">Do you <strong>plan on</strong> . . .&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">We <strong>belong to</strong> . . .</td>
          <td width="50%">This could <strong>lead to</strong> . . .</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&nbsp;My answer will <strong>depend on</strong> . . .</td>
          <td>You can <strong>rely on</strong> . . .&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>They <strong>fight for</strong> . . .</td>
          <td>We <strong>fight </strong> <strong>against</strong> . . .</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>We <strong>contribute to</strong> . . .</td>
          <td>I&nbsp;<strong>believe in</strong> . . .</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3><strong>Adjective + Preposition Combinations</strong></h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>English also has many instances of prepositions coming after adjectives.&nbsp;In many cases, the prepositions precede phrases containing nouns, as in example (a), or pronouns, as in example (b).&nbsp;It is also possible for the prepositions to precede an -ing verb, as in (c). </p>
      <p class="example">(a)&nbsp;I was <strong>amazed at</strong> all the improvements.<br />
        (b)&nbsp;We were all <strong>shocked by</strong> his behaviour. <br />
        (c)&nbsp;Because the exam was more difficult than I expected, I'm <strong>worried about</strong> passing. </p>
      <p>Here are some more adjectives and prepositions that are used together: </p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="10">
        <tr>
          <td>proud of</td>
          <td>identical to</td>
          <td>different
            from</td>
          <td>tired of</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>related to</td>
          <td>opposed to</td>
          <td>satisfied
            with</td>
          <td>eager for</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>based on</td>
          <td>famous for</td>
          <td>necessary for</td>
          <td>excited
            about&nbsp; </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>Common Sentence Errors with Prepositions</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>There are three common types of sentence errors which involve prepositions.</p>
      <p>1. Using a preposition which doesn't fit the context of the sentence:</p>
      <p class="example">I was amazed <strong>from</strong> all the improvements.&nbsp;<img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span class="emphasis_maroon">Wrong!</span><br />
        I was amazed<strong> at </strong>all the improvements. <img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span style="color: #0000FF">Right!</span> </p>
      <p>2. Omitting a preposition that belongs in a sentence:</p>
      <p class="example">I was amazed <strong>all</strong> the improvements.&nbsp;<img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span class="emphasis_maroon">Wrong!</span><br />
        I was amazed<strong> at </strong>all the improvements. <img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span style="color: #0000FF">Right!</span>
      <p>3. Adding a preposition which is not needed in the sentence:</p>
      <p class="example">I was amazed <strong>at that</strong> the improvements were done so quickly.&nbsp;<img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span class="emphasis_maroon">Wrong!</span><br />
        I was amazed<strong> that </strong>the improvements were done so quickly. <img src="../../images/arrow_rt.gif" alt="arrrow to the right" width="19" height="12" />&nbsp; <span style="color: #0000FF">Right!</span> </p>

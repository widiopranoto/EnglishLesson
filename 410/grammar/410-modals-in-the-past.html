    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Modals in the Past</h1>
    <h2><strong>Formation of Present and Past Modals</strong></h2>
    <h3>Present or future actions</h3>
    <div class="block">
    <p>When showing present or future time, the modal auxiliaries <strong>might, may, could, must </strong>and <strong>should</strong> precede the simple form of the verb, as in the example sentences below.</p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>My friend got two speeding tickets last week.  He <strong>must be</strong> a fast driver.  (present)</p>
    <p>The weather report said the temperature <strong>might drop</strong> below freezing level overnight.  (future)</p>
    </div>
    <p>To form a negative sentence, place <strong>not</strong> directly after the modal.</p>
    <p class="example">She said she <strong>might not come</strong>.</p>
    <p>A modal followed by <strong>be + progressive verb</strong> shows that the speaker thinks an action is happening at the moment.</p>
    <p class="example">Don’t make so much noise.  My father <strong>might be sleeping</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Past actions</h3>
    <div class="block">
    <p>When expressing past actions, <strong>might, may, could, must </strong>and <strong>should</strong> precede <strong>have + past participle</strong>, as in the following example.</p>
    <p class="example">The explosion was very loud.  Even people living several kilometers away <strong>must have heard</strong> it.</p>
    <p>To form a negative past tense modal sentence, use <strong>modal + not + have + past participle</strong>.</p>
    <p class="example">Tom is usually a good student , but he did poorly on the last test.<strong>  </strong>He <strong>might not have understood </strong>the instructions.</p>
    <p>To say you think an action was happening at a time in the past, use <strong>modal + have been + progressive verb</strong>, as in the next example.</p>
    <p class="example">The fire alarm sounded very early in the morning.  Most residents of the building <strong>must have been sleeping</strong> at the time.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Meaning and Use</h2>
    <h3>1. Might have, may have, could have</h3>
    <div class="block">
    <p><strong>Might have, may have </strong>and <strong>could have </strong>are used to show past possibility.  In other words, they are guesses about what happened at a period before now.  See the examples below. </p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>I can’t find my glasses.  I <strong>might have left</strong> them in the car.</p>
    <p>She promised to be here by now, but I don’t see her.  She <strong>may have missed</strong> the bus.</p>
    <p>The lights are all off in the house next door..  Our neighbours <strong>could have gone </strong>out.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3>2. Could have</h3>
    <div class="block">
    <p><strong> Could have</strong> is also used to talk about something the speaker was able to do in the past but didn’t.</p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>We were all having so much fun that we <strong>could have</strong> stayed longer.  (We didn’t stay longer.)</p>
    <p>I <strong>could have finished</strong> the report if I had stayed longer at the office.  (I didn’t stay longer at the office.  I went home.)</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3>3. Must have</h3>
    <div class="block">

    <p><strong> Must have</strong> is used to show probability in the past.  That is, the speaker is almost certain that an action took place at a time before now.</p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>There’s no milk in the refrigerator.  We <strong>must have drunk</strong> it all.</p>
    <p>Many more cars than usual were parked on our street last night.  Someone <strong>must have had</strong> a party. </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3>4. Should have, ought to have for advice</h3>
    <div class="block">

    <p><strong>Should have</strong> and <strong>ought to have </strong>are used to express advice or offer an opinion regarding the past.  It refers to an action that would have been good or appropriate, but never happened. </p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>John missed the bus.  He <strong>should have left</strong> his house a few minutes earlier.  (He didn’t.)</p>
    <p>John missed the bus.  He <strong>ought to have left</strong> his house a few minutes earlier.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3>5. Should have, ought to have for expectation</h3>
    <div class="block">

    <p><strong> Should have </strong>and <strong>ought to have</strong> are also used to express past expectation.  </p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>John <strong>should have been</strong> here by now.  (I expected him to be here by now, but he isn’t.)</p>
    <p> John <strong>ought to have been</strong> here by now.  </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3>6. Using &#8220;not&#8221;</h3>
    <div class="block">

    <p>The use of <strong>not</strong> with a past tense modal expresses the idea that whatever action took place was not good or appropriate. Consider the following examples.</p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>I <strong>should not have drunk</strong> so much coffee.  Now, I can’t sleep.</p>
    <p>My suitcase is too heavy.  I <strong>shouldn’t have packed</strong> so many things.</p>

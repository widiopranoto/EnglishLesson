    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> Verbs in English can be classified into two categories: <strong>stative</strong> verbs and <strong>dynamic</strong> verbs. Dynamic verbs (sometimes referred to as &quot;action verbs&quot;) usually describe actions we can take, or things that happen; stative verbs usually refer to a state or condition which is not changing or likely to change. The difference is important, because stative verbs cannot normally be used in the continuous (BE + ING) forms. This will explain the differences between the two types of verb, and give lots of examples of each kind. </p>
    <h3>Dynamic verbs </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>There are many types of dynamic verbs, but most of them describe activities or events which can begin and finish. Here are some examples: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
      <colgroup>
          <col class="column-odd" />
          <col class="column-even" />
          <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Dynamic Verb</th>
            <th scope="col">Type</th>
            <th scope="col">Examples</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>play</td>
            <td>activity</td>
            <td>She plays tennis every Friday.<br />
            She's playing tennis right now.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>melt</td>
            <td>process</td>
            <td>The snow melts every spring.<br />
              The snow is melting right now</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>hit</td>
            <td>momentary action</td>
            <td>When one boxer hits another, brain damage can result. (This suggests only ONE punch.)<br />
            When one boxer is hitting another, brain damage can result. (This suggests MANY repeated punches.)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Dynamic verbs, as you can see from the table above, can be used in the simple and perfect forms <em>(plays, played, has played, had played)</em> as well as the continuous or progressive forms <em>(is playing, was playing, has been playing, had been playing)</em>. </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Stative verbs </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p> Stative verbs usually refer to a state or condition which is quite static or unchanging. They can be divided into verbs of <strong>perception</strong> or <strong>cognition</strong> (which refer to things in the mind), or verbs of <strong>relation</strong> (which describe the relationships between things). Here are some examples: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
          <col class="column-odd" />
          <col class="column-even" />
          <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col"> Stative Verb </th>
            <th scope="col">Type</th>
            <th scope="col">Examples</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>hate</td>
            <td>perception</td>
            <td> I hate chocolate. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>believe</td>
            <td>perception</td>
            <td> She believes in UFOs. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>contain</td>
            <td> relation </td>
            <td> The box contains 24 cans of soda. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>own</td>
            <td>relation</td>
            <td> Yong owns three motorbikes. </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note that we CANNOT use these verbs in the continuous (progressive) forms; you CAN'T say &quot;*Yong is owning three cars.&quot; Owning is a state, not an action, so it is always in the simple form.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Example verbs</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Here some common stative and dynamic verbs. The lists may help you to understand what types of verbs are likely to be stative and what types are commonly dynamic. </p>
      <table class="table-vertical-lines">
        <tbody>
          <tr class="zebra-odd">
            <th> Stative Verbs</th>
            <td><strong>love</strong>; <strong>hate</strong>; <strong>like</strong>; <strong>see</strong>; <strong>hear</strong>; <strong>sound</strong>; <strong>think</strong> (meaning &quot;have an opinion&quot;); <strong>mind</strong> (meaning &quot;care about&quot;); <strong>recognize</strong>; <strong>seem</strong>; <strong>have</strong> (meaning &quot;own&quot;); <strong>prefer</strong>; <strong>doubt</strong>; <strong>consist of</strong>; <strong>mean</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr class="zebra-even">
            <th> Dynamic Verbs</th>
            <td><strong>eat</strong>; <strong>drink</strong>; <strong>go</strong>; <strong>type</strong>; <strong>read</strong>; <strong>write</strong>; <strong>listen</strong>; <strong>speak</strong>; <strong>watch</strong>; <strong>say</strong>; <strong>grow</strong>; <strong>work</strong>; <strong>sleep</strong>; <strong>cook</strong>; <strong>talk</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Dynamic verbs, as you can see from the table above, can be used in the simple and perfect forms <em>(plays, played, has played, had played)</em> as well as the continuous or progressive forms <em>(is playing, was playing, has been playing, had been playing)</em>. </p>

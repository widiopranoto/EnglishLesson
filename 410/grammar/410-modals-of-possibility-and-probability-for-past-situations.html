    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Modals of Possibility and Probability for Past Situations</h1>
    <p><strong>Must, may, might, can&#8217;t </strong>and<strong> couldn&#8217;t </strong>are used with a <strong>present perfect</strong> verb form to show how certain a speaker is that a past situation happened or didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
    <h3>Affirmative</h3>
    <p><strong> Formula: MODAL + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE </strong>(to show how certain the speaker is that something happened)    </p>
    <div class="block">
      <p><strong>Must have + past participle</strong> shows a great deal of certainty that something happened, but there is still some doubt in the speaker&#8217;s mind. He/she is not 100% certain. For example:</p>
    <p class="example">The students did well on the test. They <strong>must have studied</strong> hard. </p>
    <p>(There are other possible reasons why the students did well on the test. It might have been very easy, or they might have already learned the material. The speaker uses <strong>must have studied hard</strong> to show that he/she thinks this is the most logical reason they did so well.)  For example:</p>
    <p class="example">I&#8217;ve phoned Jim several times, but he doesn&#8217;t answer. He <strong>must have gone </strong>out. </p>
    <p>(The speaker believes this is the most logical reason why Jim doesn&#8217;t answer the phone. However, other reasons are possible. He might not have heard the phone, or he might not have wanted to talk to anyone.) </p>
    <p><strong>May, might </strong>and<strong> could </strong>convey the idea that a speaker is only 50% or less certain that<strong> </strong>something happened. The use of <strong>could </strong>implies a little more certainty.  For example:</p>
    <p class="example">My wife doesn&#8217;t answer the phone. She <strong>may (might, could) have gone</strong> shopping.</p>
    <p>(The speaker doesn&#8217;t know for sure that his wife went shopping. However, it is his best guess.)</p>
    </div>
      <h3>Negative</h3>
      <p><strong> Formula: MODAL + NOT + BASE VERB + PAST PARTICIPLE </strong>(to show how certain the speaker is that something didn&#8217;t happen)</p>
    <div class="block">
    <p><strong>Can&#8217;t </strong>or<strong> couldn&#8217;t have + past participle</strong> shows that the speaker is very certain something didn&#8217;t happen. For example:</p>
    <p class="example">Robin looks tired today. She <strong>can&#8217;t have slept</strong> well last night.</p>
    <p>(This is the speaker&#8217;s best guess as to why Robin looks tired. Of course, other reasons are possible. For instance, she might be ill.)</p>
    <p><strong>May </strong>or<strong> might not have + past participle </strong>shows that the speaker is 50% or less certain that something didn&#8217;t happen.  For example:</p>
    <p class="example">There was a strange light in the sky yesterday evening. I don&#8217;t know for sure what it was, but I may have seen a U.F.O. (Unidentified Flying Object).</p>
    <p><strong>An appropriate modal + have</strong> is used in most short answers. However, if the question has a be verb, the formula for responding is <strong>appropriate modal + have been</strong>. For example:</p>
    <div class="example">
    <p>Person A: Has Jennifer decided which courses she&#8217;s going to take next semester?</p>
    <p>Person B: I&#8217;m not sure. She <strong>might have</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
    <p>Person C: Do you think Tim enjoyed the concert?</p>
    <p>Person D: I don&#8217;t know. He<strong> may have</strong>.</p>
    </div>

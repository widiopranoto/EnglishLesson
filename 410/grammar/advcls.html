    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Adverb Clauses    </h1>
    <p>An adverb may be a single word such as <em>quickly</em>, <em>here</em> or <em>yesterday</em> (see the page <a href="adverb.html">Adverbs</a>), or a phrase such as <em>the day before yesterday</em> or <em>to see my mother</em> (see the page <a href="advphr.html">Adverb Phrases</a>). However, adverbs can also be clauses, containing a subject and a full verb. This page will explain the basic types of adverb clauses (sometimes called &quot;adverbial clauses&quot;) and how to recognize them.</p>
    <h3>Adverbs, adverb phrases, and adverb clauses</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Look at these sentences:</p>
      <div class="example">I saw the movie <strong>yesterday</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        I saw the movie <strong>on Friday</strong>.<br />
        <br />
        I saw the movie <strong>before I left for Calgary</strong>.</div>
      <p>In the first sentence, &#8220;yesterday&#8221; is a one-word adverb, &#8220;on Friday&#8221; is an adverb phrase, and &#8220;before I left for Calgary&#8221; is an adverb clause. All of them answer the question &#8220;When?&#8221;, but the adverb clause has a subject (&#8220;I&#8221;) and a full verb (&#8220;left&#8221;). It is introduced by &#8220;before&#8221;, so it is a <em>dependent clause</em>. This means that it cannot stand alone: &#8220;Before I left for Calgary&#8221; would not be a full sentence. It needs a main clause (&#8220;I saw the movie&#8221;). An adverb clause, then, is a dependent clause that does the same job as an adverb or an adverb phrase.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Types of adverb clause </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>There are many types of adverb clauses. Here are some examples of the most common types:</p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Type</th>
            <th scope="col">Question answered</th>
            <th scope="col">Example</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td> Place </td>
            <td> Where? </td>
            <td> Wherever there are computers, there is Microsoft software. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Time </td>
            <td> When? </td>
            <td> After the fruit is harvested, it is sold at the market. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Cause </td>
            <td> Why? (What caused this?) </td>
            <td> I didn't call her because I'm shy. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Purpose </td>
            <td> Why? (What was the reason for doing this?) </td>
            <td> She took a computer course so that she could get a better job. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Concession </td>
            <td> Why is this unexpected? </td>
            <td> Although Jay has a Master's degree, he works as a store clerk. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> Condition </td>
            <td> Under what conditions? </td>
            <td> If you save your money, you will be able to go to college. </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>As you can see from the examples above, most adverb clauses can be recognized because they are introduced by a particular word or phrase (such as &quot;when&quot; and &quot;so that&quot;). These words and phrases are called <strong>subordinating conjunctions</strong>, and there are many of them, including these: </p>
      <p class="example">after, before, until, while, because, since, as, so that, in order that, if, unless, whether, though, although, even though, where</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> The <em>past continuous tense</em> (also called the <em>past progressive tense</em>) is commonly used in English for actions which were going on (had not finished) at a particular time in the past. This page will explain the rules for forming the tense, and how it is used. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Forming the past continuous tense </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>This tense was formed using two components: the verb BE (in the past tense), and the -ING form of a verb. Here are the rules, using the example verb &quot;sing&quot;: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Subject </th>
            <th>BE </th>
            <th>-ING Form </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>I </td>
            <td>was </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>You </td>
            <td>were </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>He </td>
            <td>was </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>She </td>
            <td>was </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>It </td>
            <td>was </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>We </td>
            <td>were </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They </td>
            <td>were </td>
            <td><em>singing</em></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>2. When to use the past continuous </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>The past continuous is usually used when one action began before another, and finished after it. Consider this sentence:</p>
      <p class="example">I was reading when he arrived.</p>
      <p> In other words I started reading (maybe at 8 o'clock), then he arrived (maybe at 9 o'clock), then I finished reading (maybe at 10 o'clock). Here is a diagram:</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/g330-pascon-reading.gif" alt="timeline shows that he arrived at 9:00 and I was reading at 8:00, 9:00, and 10:00." /></p>
      <p> We can also use the tense when we talk about an action that had already started and was still continuing at a particular time:</p>
      <p class="example">At five o'clock, it was raining.</p>
      <p> In other words it started raining (maybe at 4 o'clock), and finished raining later (maybe at 6 o'clock). Here is a diagram:</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/g330-pascon-raining.gif" alt="timeline shows that it was raining at 4:00, at the specific time of 5:00, and at 6:00." /></p>
      <p> Finally, we can use this tense to describe TWO actions that were BOTH continuing at the same time in the past. In this case, we use the past continuous for both actions:</p>
      <p class="example">While I was sleeping, she was working.</p>
      <p> In other words I started sleeping and she started working (maybe at 10 o'clock), and we both finished our actions later (maybe at 12 o'clock). Here is a diagram:</p>
      <p><img src="../../images/g330-pascon-sleeping.gif" alt="timeline shows that I am sleeping and she is sleeping at 10:00, at 11:00, and at 12:00" /></p>

    <h1><img src="../../images/wb-gram.gif" alt="building blocks" />Simple Past: Negatives and Questions</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> In the simple past tense, negative and question forms are made using the auxiliary verb &quot;do&quot; (in its past form, &quot;did&quot;) followed by the simple form of the main verb. This page explains the rules. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Forming a negative </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Negatives in the simple past are formed by adding <em>didn't</em> (informal) or <em>did not</em> (formal) before the simple form of the verb. The verb BE is an exception to this; in the case of BE, we just add <em>n't</em> (informal) or <em>not</em> (formal) after &quot;was&quot; or &quot;were&quot;: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Simple past statement </th>
            <th>Informal negative </th>
            <th>Formal negative </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>I had a car. </td>
            <td>I didn't have a car. </td>
            <td>I did not have a car. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>You ate my toast. </td>
            <td>You didn't eat my toast. </td>
            <td>You did not eat my toast. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>He was here yesterday. </td>
            <td>He wasn't here yesterday. </td>
            <td>He was not here yesterday. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They were in the park. </td>
            <td>They weren't in the park. </td>
            <td>They were not in the park. </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>2. Forming a yes/no question </h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Yes/no questions are also created using the auxiliary <em>did</em>. This time, the auxiliary is placed before the subject. The verb BE is an exception; in this case, we move BE before the subject. Here are the rules: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Simple past statement </th>
            <th>Yes/no question </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>He brought his friend. </td>
            <td>Did he bring his friend? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They had a party. </td>
            <td>Did they have a party? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>You were here. </td>
            <td>Were you here? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>She was sick. </td>
            <td>Was she sick? </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
    <h3>3. Forming a WH- question</h3>
    <div class="block">
      <p>WH- questions (using words such as &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, and &quot;where&quot;) are also created by putting the auxiliary <em>did</em> before the subject (or moving BE, as explained above). Then, you add the WH- word at the beginning. Here are some examples: </p>
      <table class="table-horizontal-lines">
        <colgroup>
        <col class="column-odd" />
        <col class="column-even" />
        <col class="column-odd" />
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Statement </th>
            <th>Yes/no question </th>
            <th>WH- question </th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>The building fell down. </td>
            <td>Did the building fall down? </td>
            <td>Why did the building fall down? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They lived in Vancouver. </td>
            <td>Did they live in Vancouver? </td>
            <td>Where did they live? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>The store was closed. </td>
            <td>Was the store closed? </td>
            <td>Why was the store closed? </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>They were wolves. </td>
            <td>Were they wolves? </td>
            <td>What were they? </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
